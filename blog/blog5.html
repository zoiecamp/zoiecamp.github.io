    <p>During the past 2 weeks, I continued working on the building range effects, but this time with much better results. After many many hours of banging my head against a wall, I am finally on the right track toward the desired results.</p>
    <p><strong>Total Time: </strong>12h 30m</p>

    <p><strong>(2h) Experimenting With Shaders and Tilemaps</strong></p>
    <p>At the beginning of this 2-week sprint, I reached out to a member of one of the R&D teams to ask for advice on how he had created this shader effect for their tile-based game: </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="week5_inspo.png" alt="Image 1">
    </div>
    <p>He provided me with a script that converts each tile in the range to a single pixel in a texture, as well as a shader that uses that texture to figure out which tile a rendered pixel belongs to. This makes a lot of sense for square tiles, but is significantly more complicated for Project Dragonheart’s hexagonal-tile-based map. After about 2 hours of trying to modify his approach and achieving results such as the ones below, I realized that this simply wasn’t going to work.

        </video>
    </div>
    <p>The good news is that this attempt helped me learn a lot about how shaders work and what my next approach should be. I realized that what I needed is for each tile in the range to know what its world position is, and use distance from its world position to some central position to create my effect. I couldn’t find any way to achieve this by applying a shader to the tilemap renderer, because each tile shares the properties of the shader. But, I realized that since the shape of the range surrounding a single building is a fixed number of tiles, I might be able to create a single sprite representing the range of one building and kind of “merge” these together as more buildings are placed and the range expands. Then, each sprite would be able to know its own world position and the position of the center of the effect. This idea was very abstract at this point and I wasn’t 100% confident that it made sense or would work, but I kind of just dove in and tried to tackle it step by step.</p>

    <p><strong>(6h 30m) Experimenting With Shaders and Sprites</strong></p>

    <p>First, I experimented with converting shader coordinates to world-space coordinates so that I could create an effect like this, where each pixel calculates its world position, determines its distance from the specified "effect center", and gets highlighted based on this distance and elapsed time: </p>
    <div class="video-container">
        <video controls style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
            <source src="week5_test_1.mp4" type="video/mp4">

        </video>
    </div>
    <p>Next, I made sure that if I placed 2 of these sprites next to each other with the same shader, they could share the same central position for the effect but store their own world positions so that the rings could expand smoothly over the entire area (the effect isn’t perfectly smooth yet in this video but I fix that later):</p>
    <div class="video-container">
        <video controls style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
            <source src="week5_test_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">

        </video>
    </div>
    <p>Next, I needed to get rid of the transparency stacking between the two sprites. This unfortunately took me like 3 hours to figure out. I tried to use the stencil buffer to do this, making each sprite write to the stencil buffer in such a way that subsequent sprites wouldn’t render in the same area. I thought I could give each sprite a different ref value, create a first pass where the stencil buffer is only written in areas where it hasn’t been written yet, and then a second pass where the sprite is only rendered in areas where the stencil buffer equals the ref value. It took me an unfortunately large amount of time to figure out that this wasn’t working because Unity’s URP doesn’t support multiple passes in shaders. I was starting to think my idea was doomed, but I finally discovered that all I had to do was add these 2 lines of code to my shader, and it worked!</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <pre><code>
          ZWrite On
          ZTest Less
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="video-container">
        <video controls style="width: 30%; height: auto;">

            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
    </div>
    <p>Now that this was working, I spent some time creating this sprite in the shape of a single building’s range:</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="week5_area_sprite.png" alt="Image 1">
    </div>
    <p>To wrap up this week’s work, I implemented some code to generate these at each tower position, thus spanning the range of the map:</p>
    <div class="video-container">
        <video controls style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
            <source src="week5_success.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
    </div>
    <p>The next steps for this are to experiment with different colors and effects and add the code to integrate this into all the existing functionality that enables/disables the range and expands it as buildings are added.</p>


    
    <p><strong>(4h) Studio Meetings</strong></p>
    <p>I attended both Sunday studio meetings where we shared updates on progress and had group work time.</p>
