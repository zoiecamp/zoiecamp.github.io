    <p>My task for this week was once again related to adding juice and polish to the game, but this time in the form of creating some kind of animated shader effect for building effect ranges. This was once again an open-ended and creative task, which was once again difficult for me. It felt like there was more pressure this week because the team liked the particle effects I implemented last week, so it felt like there were higher expectations to implement something that looks good. As mentioned in my previous post, I work best with a clear guideline of what to implement and what it should look like, and I struggle with these kinds of subjective tasks where what “looks good” is different to everybody. But, since I only had one week, most of my time was spent brainstorming ideas and learning about shaders and tilemaps, so I don’t really have any good results yet.</p>
