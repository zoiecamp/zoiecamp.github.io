    <p>During these 2 weeks, I spent the majority of my time working on the shader effect for the building ranges. I was finally able to get it finished, which was a massive sense of relief and accomplishment, as I’ve spent many many weeks thinking that it just wasn’t ever going to happen, but I’m really proud of the final result. After that, I was able to move on to a few other tasks - implementing a quick credits screen on the home page and starting on a charm system for adventurers.</p>
    <p><strong>Total Time: </strong>12h</p>
  
    <p><strong>(6h) Finished Animated Building Range Effect</strong></p>
    <p>After finally figuring out how to get this working last week, there were still a couple of things that needed to be done to finish it up, but it definitely went much faster and I was feeling much more confident now that the seemingly impossible part had been accomplished.</p>
    <p>First, I spent about 3 hours just going through the code and finding every place where the range of a building is expanded or shrunk and where the visible range map is activated or deactivated. I integrated code for my new effect into all of these cases:</p>
    <p>video</p>
    <p>Now that the implementation itself was fully functional, I spent about an hour and a half working on the visuals of the shader. I first realized that the hex range I had drawn was the wrong size, so I had to fix that, which also somehow magically fixed this issue where the edges of the sprite were being cut off.</p>

    <p>I’m not sure how that happened but I’m relieved because I thought that was going to be a nightmare bug to fix. Then, I played around with the colors, messed with the speed and size of the rings, and added some sine wave math to distort the shapes, to achieve this final result:</p>

    <p>It took me another 30 minutes to get this working for the range of the farm as well. I took this video which kind of encapsulates the entire finished result of these weeks:</p>

    <p>Finally, I spent another hour just working on my merge request, because I did not stay up to date with changes to the projects as I worked on this and there were many merge conflicts (oops).</p>

    <p><strong>(30m) Credits Scene</strong></p>
    <p>I was tasked with creating a credits scene for the game. I was told to look at Defenders of the Dune to see what they did, so I had to go find a Windows computer to run it on, which is honestly what took the most time. Then I realized that Project Dragonheart already had a credits screen implemented on the home screen, so I just had to replace the names of the R&D team with all of the studio members this semester.</p>

    <p><strong>(1h 30m) Implementing Charm System</strong></p>
    <p>Finally, I was tasked with implementing a quick charm system. In the game, charms are a type of gear that adventurers can equip and that give a specific type of benefit - some examples provided were resurrecting the user of the charm when they die, or boosting the gold found in the dungeon. I started looking into this very quickly to figure out how to implement it, but I need to talk to other members at the meeting about the specifics of how the dungeon works before I can finish it up.</p>

    <p><strong>(4h) Studio Meetings</strong></p>
    <p>I attended both weekly studio meetings where we shared updates on progress and had group work time.</p>
